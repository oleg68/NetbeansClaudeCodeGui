- Fixed choice menu not updating when Claude replaces one menu with another (e.g. multi-select → confirm screen)
- Fixed session getting stuck in Working state after Claude finishes when the response contains the ⌕ character
- Fixed session incorrectly remaining in Ready state while /resume session picker is open
- Fixed choice menu items having text in parentheses stripped (e.g. "Bash(find ...)" was shown as "Bash")
- Added right-click context menu ("Copy URL", "Open in Browser") to the Base URL field in Options → Profiles; items are disabled when the Other API connection type is not selected or the field is blank
- Improved session state detection reliability; fixed cases where the Ready state was not detected correctly
- Added IDE Tools (MCP) section to the user manual with a full tool reference and example prompts
- Fixed MCP server connection failures that prevented Claude from using IDE tools (affected both Claude Code 2.x and multiple simultaneous sessions)
- Fixed terminal scrolling to the beginning when a choice menu or diff panel appears; the terminal now stays scrolled to the bottom
- Improved JediTerm terminal colors to match the current NetBeans Look &amp; Feel theme (background, foreground, selection color, and empty terminal area)
- Improved Markdown Preview colors to adapt to the current IDE theme (dark/light), including code blocks, tables, and blockquote highlights
- Fixed second choice menu not appearing after the first one is submitted
- Added support for multi-select menus (AskUserQuestion with multiSelect: true): checkboxes now appear instead of radio buttons
- Improved process launch error panel
- Documented status bar in user manual: edit mode selector with all modes, model selector, and right-side labels (session state, active plan, Claude version)
- Added support for multiple custom models in the model combo: models assigned the "custom" alias in Model Aliases appear in the dropdown and are switched via `/model <id>` command
- Added Refresh context menu item to Markdown Preview tab (re-reads file from disk, restores scroll position)
- Improved process launch error display: shows the attempted command and error message in a dedicated panel with a Back button and copyable text fields
- Fixed "Clear Older" in history dialog to include the selected entry in deletion and to show exact date and time in the confirmation prompt
